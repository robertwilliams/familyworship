# Advent

Tonight is the beginning of Advent.  Advent just means "coming".  It is the time when we remember the first time Jesus came to Earth, as a little baby, on Christmas.  And we also look forward to when Jesus will come back to Earth one day to take us all to live in Heaven with Him.

Each Sunday we will light another candle, and then on Christmas Eve, we'll light the last one.
