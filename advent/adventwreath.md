# Advent Wreath

Notice the wreath itself.  You see that it's a circle.  A circle has no beginning, and no end.  That reminds us of God.  God has always been, and always will be.  God is eternal.

The next thing to notice is that the branches are green.  Green is the color of living things. If you look out the window, you'll see that many trees have started to lose their leaves, and most of the grass is brown.  But these branches stand for *life*.  Just like God gives us eternal life through Jesus.

The last thing to notice is that the candles each give us light in the darkness.  Listen to what the Bible says about Jesus:

> John 1:1-5 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. In him was life, and the life was the light of men.  The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

> John 8:12 Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”

But did you know that *we* are supposed to be light, too?  Here's what the Bible says:

> Matthew 5:14-16 “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.”

> Philippians 2:14-16 Do all things without grumbling or disputing, that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life
