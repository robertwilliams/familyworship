### First Sunday

* Light a purple candle

Prayer:

> As our nights grow longer and our days grow short, we look on these earthly signs -- light and green branches -- and remember God's promise to our world:  Christ, our Light and our Hope, will come.  

The first candle stands for *promise* or *prophecy* or *hope*.

Even though Jesus was born two thousand years ago, people had been waiting for Him for much, much longer.  This candle reminds us that God kept His promise to send Jesus, and that Jesus will keep His promise to come again one day.

Right after Adam and Eve rebelled against God, do you know what God did?  He punished them, but He *also* promised them that He was going to fix it all.  He said He would send someone to destroy Satan even though the Savior would also be hurt.  That was Jesus.

God kept making promises to His people.  He told Abraham that He would make Abraham into a great nation, and that through Abraham all the nations in the Earth would be blessed.  The Bible tells us that *we* are part of that great nation if we love God like Abraham did.  And the part about how all nations would be blessed through Abraham - that's because Jesus was a descendant of Abraham.

Later, after the nation of Israel was created, God spoke to King David.  He told David that one of David's descendants would always be a king.  God kept that promise through Jesus too!  Jesus is called the "Son of David" and He rules over the entire world.

Over and over, God promised to send a Savior, or the *Messiah*, to save the world from all the evil that came after Adam and Eve sinned.

Listen to the words of Isaiah the prophet: 

> Isaiah 9:2, 6-7

> The people who walked in darkness
have seen a great light;
those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness,
on them has light shone.

> For to us a child is born,
to us a son is given;
and the government shall be upon his shoulder,
and his name shall be called
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

> Of the increase of his government and of peace
there will be no end,
on the throne of David and over his kingdom,
to establish it and to uphold it
with justice and with righteousness
from this time forth and forevermore.

> The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.

God kept the first part of His promise when Jesus was born.  Jesus never sinned.  He obeyed God perfectly.  And then He suffered and died for our sins so that we could be at peace with God.  And then three days later, God raised Him from the dead!  Then He went back up to Heaven.

But that's not everything!  Jesus promised us that He would come back one day to finally destroy the Devil, get rid of all our sin, and take us up to Heaven to live with Him.  So while God has already kept part of His promise, we're still waiting for the rest of it.

So we remember how people waited and waited for Jesus to come the first time, and we remember that God kept His promise.  That is how we know that God will keep His promise for Jesus to come back again.

Prayer:

> O God,  rejoicing,  we remember the promise of your Son. As the light from this candle,  may the blessing of Christ come upon us,  brightening our way  and guiding us by his truth.  May Christ our Savior bring life  into the darkness of our world, and to us, as we wait for his coming. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen
