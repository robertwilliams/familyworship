## Second Sunday

* Light a purple candle

The second candle stands for *love*.

Last time we learned that ever since Adam and Eve sinned, God had promised to send Jesus to us, to die for our sins.

But *why* did God do that?

Here's what Jesus said:

> John 3:16-17

> For God so loved the world,that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.  For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.

God sent Jesus for us, because God loved us.

And God's love won't ever stop!  Here's what God told Isaiah the prophet to tell the people:

> Isaiah 54:10

> For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you,

God wants us to show His love too.  For starters, He wants us to love Him back.

> Deuteronomy 6:5

> You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.

> Deut 10:12-13

> [W]hat does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and to keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD

And secondly, God wants us to love each other.

> Leviticus 19:18

> you shall love your neighbor as yourself

In fact, Jesus said that's how people will know we are His followers:

> John 13:34-35

> [J]ust as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.  By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.

Prayer:

> Lord God, we light this candle to thank you for your Son our Savior Jesus Christ, who you sent because of your great love for us.  We who like sheep have gone astray have found the way to you through Jesus Christ.  Teach us to love You and to love each other.  Amen.
